I² by pai
In order to install I², please read and choose one of the following methods:

Either you

Run the included I2.MSI file 

OR

Create your own mIRC environment for running I² and place the script files there.

METHOD 1
The easiest way would be running the included I2.MSI file. The MSI file will:
1. Check if mIRC is installed on Windows. If not found it halts, else it will...;
2. ...create %appdata%\I2;
3. ...create %appdata%\I2\script
3. ...place mirc.ini in %appdata%\I2 and place I2.MRC and I2.TXT in %appdata%\I2\script
4. ...create a folder and shortcut in the windows start menu. Simply double-click on this shortcut to start mIRC + I²!

METHOD 2
By manually creating your own mirc environment for running I² you have more control over where the files are installed. 
This could be archieved in a variety of ways. For example:
1. Create a folder in Windows Explorer under %appdata% called 'I2'
2. Place the I2.TXT and I2.MRC files in %appdata%\I2
3. Create a shortcut on the desktop and point it to:
"C:\Program	Files (x86)\mIRC\mIRC.exe" -r%appdata%\I2
4. Double click on the shortcut to run mirc against this environment.
5. In mIRC type '/load -rs i2.mrc' . You will only have to do this once.
